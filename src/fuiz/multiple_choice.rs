//! Multiple choice question implementation
//!
//! This module implements the multiple choice question type for Fuiz games.
//! Multiple choice questions present a question followed by several answer
//! options, allowing players to select one correct answer. The module handles
//! timing, scoring, answer validation, and result presentation.

//! Pin (drop a marker on an image) question implementation
//!
//! Players tap a point on the slide's image. Two flavours share this module
//! because the mechanic is identical and only the scoring differs:
//!
//! - **Pin answer** — `correct_area` is set, and a pin inside it earns points.
//! - **Drop pin** — `correct_area` is absent, so the slide simply collects
//!   opinions and the room sees where everyone pinned.
//!
//! Coordinates are normalised to `0.0..=1.0` of the image's width and height,
//! so they survive any rendering size. Values arriving outside that box are
//! clamped rather than rejected — a pin dropped a pixel off the edge is still
//! a pin.

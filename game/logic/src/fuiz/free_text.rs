//! Free-text (word cloud and open ended) question implementation
//!
//! Players type their own answers instead of picking from a list. Two flavours
//! share this module because both collect a bag of strings and report how often
//! each was said; only the presentation and the normalisation differ:
//!
//! - [`Mode::WordCloud`] — short entries, several per player, matched
//!   case-insensitively so "Paris" and "paris" pile into the same word.
//! - [`Mode::OpenEnded`] — one longer response per player, kept verbatim.
//!
//! Both collect opinions, so no answer is correct and no points are awarded.

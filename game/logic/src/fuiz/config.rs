//! Fuiz configuration and question management
//!
//! This module defines the core configuration structures for Fuiz games,
//! including the main `Fuiz` struct, slide configurations, and the runtime
//! state management for different question types. It provides the central
//! coordination layer that manages question flow and state transitions.

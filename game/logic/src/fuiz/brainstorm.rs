//! Brainstorm (collect ideas, then vote on them) question implementation
//!
//! A brainstorm runs in two acts. First every player contributes ideas, which
//! land on a shared board and the host watches them arrive live. Then the board
//! is opened for voting and each player spends a small budget of votes on the
//! ideas they like best. The results rank the board by votes.
//!
//! Brainstorms collect opinions, so nothing is correct and no points are
//! awarded; the slide still records a zero for every player so per-slide point
//! arrays stay aligned with slide indices.
